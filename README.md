# Awesome Agent Memory

A curated collection and reference for memory systems, patterns, research, and implementations used by autonomous agents and conversational assistants.

This repository gathers architectures, libraries, design patterns, benchmarks, and resources that help agents remember, retrieve, summarize, and reason over past interactions and external knowledge. It targets researchers, engineers, and practitioners building memory-enabled agents (chatbots, digital assistants, multi-agent systems).

## Why agent memory matters

Modern agents need to maintain state across turns, remember user preferences, and use long-term context to provide consistent, personalized, and safe responses. Good memory systems improve usefulness, reduce repetition, and enable more complex multi-step workflows.

Key challenges:

- Scalability: storing and searching large volumes of past interactions or documents.
- Relevance: selecting what to remember and what to forget.
- Latency: retrieving context fast enough for interactive use.
- Consistency & Safety: avoiding hallucinations and protecting private data.

## Typical memory patterns

- Short-term / working memory: recent conversation turns kept in RAM.
- Episodic memory: snapshots of full interactions stored for later retrieval.
- Semantic memory: embeddings of text/documents for similarity search.
- Procedural memory: learned policies, action histories, or macros.
- Summarization: compressing long interactions into concise notes.
- Forgetting / pruning: TTL, LRU, heuristics, or learned retention.

## Security & privacy

Memory systems commonly store potentially sensitive user data. Follow these practices:

- Minimize retention of sensitive data and provide TTLs.
- Use encryption at rest and in transit.
- Anonymize or redact PII before storing if possible.
- Provide clear user controls and opt-outs.
